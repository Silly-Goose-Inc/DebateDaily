In debate, we tend to fixate on speeches. The 1AC that was fire. The 2NR that collapsed. The 1AR that scrambled. When we analyze losses, we almost always go to what was said *in-round* — what went wrong, what we could’ve said better, how we dropped something major. That’s fair. But sometimes, the truth is simpler:

You lost the round **before the 1AC was even read.**

## 1. You Didn’t Set Up Your Docs Properly

Yes, this is basic — but how many rounds have been lost because someone couldn’t find their frontlines, or the wrong doc was shared, or you spent half of prep time scrolling instead of prepping?

**Pro move:**  
- Keep your doc library clean.  
- Make your round file *before* the tournament starts.  
- Always title your docs clearly: `"TOPIC - Round vs [Team] - Aff"` not `"Untitled document (7)"`.

Being fast and organized isn’t about aesthetics — it buys you seconds of calm in a round where most people panic.

## 2. You Didn’t Know the Judge

It takes five minutes to look up a judge on Tabroom. That five minutes can win or lose the round.

**Things you should know before round starts:**  
- Are they lay, flow, or circuit?  
- Do they care about extensions or card warrants?  
- What do they *hate*?  
- Have they judged your opponent before?

You don’t need a whole paradigm breakdown. You just need *enough* to adjust the margins — to win 3-2s instead of lose them.

## 3. You Didn’t Have a Win Condition

Too many teams walk into a round thinking “I’ll just try my best.” That’s not a strategy — that’s a hope.

**Before round starts, ask:**  
- “What do we win on?”  
- “What’s our path if the aff is messy?”  
- “What are we *definitely* not going for?”

You don’t have to lock yourself into a strat. You just need to orient your brain toward *winning* — not just surviving.

## 4. You Let the Vibe Dictate the Round

If you’re panicking because your opponents look confident, or their cards sound flashier, or they walk in with a 3NR speaker award… pause.

**They haven’t won anything — yet.**

The *vibe* of the round is something you can control. Walk in grounded. Control the setup. Take CX space confidently. Project belief. Rounds are won by teams that play offense, not defense.

## 5. You Didn’t Pre-Prep the Right Frontlines

A week before the tournament, you knew that team read cap, or did a weird Baudrillard K, or read that same conditionality shell. But when they read it — you weren’t ready. So you scrambled. And dropped the link.

**What to do instead:**  
- Pick your top 3 opponent affs/Ks/cheats.  
- Cut or write blocks *as if they’re guaranteed*.  
- Practice deploying them out loud.

The trick isn’t just having a file. It’s internalizing the argument. Rounds are lost in the *delay* between hearing a familiar position and knowing how to respond.

## 6. You Didn’t Center Yourself

Some people lose the round before the 1AC by letting their nerves win. You walk in tense. You mumble the intro. You forget to breathe.

**Here’s what I do before most rounds:**  
- One deep breath.  
- One mental reset: “Just flow. Just think.”  
- One quick question: “What do I want them to feel?”

If you focus on clarity, not clout — intention, not intimidation — the round slows down. And then you can start to win it.

## TL;DR

Yes, speeches matter. But the decisions that *set up* those speeches happen way earlier than we think. You don’t win rounds by out-speaking someone — you win them by being ready to *debate* them.

So next time you’re prepping for a round, don’t just fixate on the 1NC or the 2AR. Ask:  
**Did I already win — or already lose — before we even said “ready?”**
