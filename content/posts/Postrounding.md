Something’s changed in debate — and not for the better.

Rounds end, ballots are submitted, and people just... leave. No questions. No reflection. No real conversation.

## What We Used to Have

Ask anyone who debated even ten years ago. The round *kept going* after the last speech. You stuck around. You talked with your opponent. You asked the judge why they voted the way they did — and got a real answer. Sometimes it was five minutes, sometimes it was forty. But those moments were where so many actually learned.

Now? It feels like everything stops when the RFD is typed into Tabroom.

We say “thanks for the round,” maybe shake hands, and vanish into the hallway or out of the Zoom call. Judges don’t have time, debaters don’t have interest, and tournaments don’t leave much room to pause.

But if you go watch older rounds on YouTube — like from the mid-2000s or early 2010s — you’ll notice something. Debaters aren’t packing up immediately. The judge is still flowing. Everyone is *talking*. It’s quieter, but deeper. You can *see* people learning.

It honestly feels like a different world.

## Why It Matters

Those conversations weren’t just filler — they were *the point*. The real reason debate mattered wasn’t just the speaker points or the win/loss record. It was the way you got better round by round.

Post-rounds gave you a chance to:

- Ask what you could’ve done differently
- Understand *why* a judge didn’t buy your argument
- Get advice from someone you’d never met
- Trade prep tips, strategy notes, or even just appreciation

It made the activity feel collaborative. Competitive, sure — but with mutual respect.

## What’s Causing the Drop-Off?

Some of it’s structural. Tournaments are more rushed. Online ballots make it easier to disappear. Everyone’s busy, tired, and trying to keep up with pairings.

But some of it’s cultural, too. We’ve made debate more cutthroat and professionalized — focused on winning above all else. And when winning becomes the only goal, people don’t want to linger after a loss. Especially not to talk to the person who just beat them.

There’s also the fear factor — people worry a post-round will get heated, or awkward, or turn into a debate *about* the debate. And that happens sometimes. But the good ones? They’re worth it.

## How We Bring It Back

If we care about keeping this activity meaningful, we should rebuild that culture. And it doesn’t take much.

- Debaters: **ask a question** after the round. Be respectful. Just say, “Would you mind explaining what decided it for you?” Or “What could we have done differently?” Nine times out of ten, they’ll be glad you asked.
- Judges: **take the time**, if you can. A two-minute breakdown can do more for a kid’s growth than a page of written feedback.
- Coaches: **model the norm**. Encourage your team to ask questions, win or lose. Show them how to do it with maturity and curiosity.
- Online? **Still possible.** Stay in the Zoom for a bit. Offer an email. Even a quick message can help.

## Final Thought

The round doesn’t end at the RFD. Or at least, it shouldn’t.

If you care about getting better — if you want this to be more than a game of technicalities and clicks — then bring back the part of debate where we learn from each other.

Talk to your opponent. Ask your judge. Stick around for five minutes. That’s how you actually grow.
