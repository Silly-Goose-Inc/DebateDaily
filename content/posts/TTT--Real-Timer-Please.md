# Tooltip Tuesday: Why Every Debater Needs a Physical Timer

In an era of Verbatim macros and cloud-stored cases, it’s easy to assume your laptop can handle everything. But one of the simplest, smartest upgrades a debater can make?  
**A dedicated physical timer.**

Here’s why the best on the circuit still carry one:

## 1. (Lay) Judge Appeal: Don’t Make Them Ask

If a judge has to stop you mid-speech and ask, *“How much time do you have left?”* — you’ve already lost credibility. A physical timer placed on the desk or podium allows judges to **track your speech in real time** without interruption.  

This subtle transparency signals preparation, respect, and control. Especially in elimination rounds or close ballots, judges notice these details. They won’t always say it out loud, but the debater who **runs clean, visible time** looks like they belong in the back rounds.


## 2. Environmental Stress: Clear Your Screen, Clear Your Mind

*Your debate computer is already juggling:*

- **Word documents**  
- **Research tabs**
- **The open case list**
- **Flow spreadsheets**
- **Tournament platforms like Tabroom or NSDA Campus**

Adding a *screen-based timer just adds more clutter* — and in high-stress moments, that’s a recipe for mistimed speeches, lost prep, or even a crash.  

A **physical timer lives outside that chaos**. It’s tactile, reliable, and instantly responsive. You don’t need to alt-tab or pray your spacebar works. Just hit a button, and go.

## The GOAT: The RadioShack 9-Button

For decades, elite debaters have sworn by the **RadioShack 9-button timer** — durable, intuitive, and instantly recognizable across national circuits. While it’s discontinued, you can still find it on:

- eBay  
- Local thrift stores  
- Swap groups  
- Debate alumni donations  

Can’t find one? **Any 9-button or dual kitchen timer** will do - just make sure it includes:

- A clear digital display  
- Loud but not disruptive beeping  
- Separate count-up/countdown functions  
- A kickstand to keep it visible

You can use timers like [This Amazon one](www.amazon.com/XREXS-Magnetic-Countdown-Directly-Input-White/dp/B012QP8ORW/ref=dp_prsubs_d_sccl_1/141-2632950-6225144?pd_rd_w=YcQG5&content-id=amzn1.sym.9023959a-379f-4911-bf85-9afa60b85373&pf_rd_p=9023959a-379f-4911-bf85-9afa60b85373&pf_rd_r=QQHH5VC4V0RB9TG6V70K&pd_rd_wg=Pj5hJ&pd_rd_r=660c29ba-299d-4946-b798-6f882f8822bb&pd_rd_i=B012QP8ORW&psc=1) - Or find one for sale at large tournaments like [This more expensive one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004S0SO9M/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_71M3CbQNT03T5)


## Pro Tip: Use Two Timers

If you really want to level up your round management: **get two physical timers** — ideally in different colors. Use one for **speech time** and one for **prep time**.

That way, you never have to mentally track prep — and your judge always has a clear, visible record of both timers. It’s a small upgrade that delivers huge consistency and **total judge transparency.**


## Final Thought

A physical timer is like an analog fallback in a digital storm. It’s a **small investment** that pays dividends in round presence, prep management, and judge perception.  

Don’t let timing be the reason you lose a speech. Let it be one of the reasons you win.
