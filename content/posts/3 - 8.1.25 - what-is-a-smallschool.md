When you hear “small school” in debate, what do you picture? A team with just a handful of members struggling to keep the program alive? A solo competitor who carries the entire school on their back? Or maybe a hidden gem quietly out-debating much larger programs? The truth is, there’s no single, clear-cut definition of what makes a school “small.” It varies depending on your circuit, your region, and the people you ask.


## So - What actually Makes a School “Small”?

Here are some of the most common ways people define small schools in the debate world:

- **Team Size:** Some measure smallness purely by the number of competitors. Schools with only one or two debaters year after year clearly fit this definition. Others may have a handful of active debaters but still lack the depth of larger programs.  
- **Program Resources:** Many small schools operate without a full-time coach or dedicated debate staff. They might rely heavily on student captains or parent volunteers, and funding for travel or prep resources can be minimal or nonexistent.  
- **Circuit Presence:** A school might be large or medium-sized locally but have little or no presence on the national circuit. Conversely, some smaller schools may focus exclusively on regional tournaments and never attend the larger, more costly national events.  
- **Community and Culture:** Sometimes, “small” is less about numbers and more about how connected the team feels. Small schools often foster tight-knit communities where every member’s contribution counts.

## Why Does It Matter?

Understanding what “small school” means is important because these programs face unique challenges—and also have unique strengths—that shape their experience in debate:

- **Challenges:**  
  - Limited coaching can mean less strategic guidance and less feedback on rounds.  
  - Smaller budgets often translate into fewer tournaments attended and less access to prep materials.  
  - Having fewer teammates can lead to less practice and fewer perspectives during prep.  

- **Strengths:**  
  - Flexibility to experiment with new strategies or debate styles without the inertia of a large program.  
  - The ability to focus deeply on individual development and customize prep around each member’s strengths and weaknesses.  
  - Stronger team bonds and more leadership opportunities for every member, since there are fewer players to share roles.


## How to Thrive as a Small School

Small schools can absolutely compete—and win—if they play to their strengths and address common hurdles strategically. Here are some key approaches:

- **Leverage Flexibility:** Big programs can be slow to shift strategies or adopt new techniques. Small schools, by contrast, can pivot quickly—trying out novel argumentation styles, adopting new research methods, or experimenting with different events.  
- **Build Networks:** Partner with other small schools or nearby programs to host scrimmages, share resources, and create a community of support. This collaboration can help offset the disadvantages of fewer internal teammates or less coaching.  
- **Prioritize Quality Over Quantity:** It’s better to have a few solid, well-understood arguments than a sprawling case that’s hard to defend. Mastery and clear delivery go a long way, especially when judges appreciate depth over speed.  
- **Embrace Your Identity:** Being a small school means flying under the radar in many cases. Use that to your advantage by surprising opponents and judges who may underestimate your team’s capabilities. Own your story and build confidence from it.


## The Bigger Picture: Why Small Schools Matter

Small schools aren’t just a footnote in the debate ecosystem; they’re a vital and vibrant part of it. They remind us that success isn’t only about roster size, funding, or tradition. It’s about grit, creativity, and smart strategy.

For many debaters, small schools offer a unique environment to grow as thinkers, leaders, and competitors. They often serve as incubators for innovation and resilience. These teams keep debate accessible and grounded, preserving a space where every voice can matter.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re part of a small school team or coach one, remember this: your impact isn’t measured by how many people you bring to tournaments, but by how well you prepare, support, and compete. Keep pushing boundaries, building connections, and sharpening your skills. Your size might be small - but your potential is huge.
