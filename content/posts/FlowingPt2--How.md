Welcome --> This is *a 102-Level Guide to Mastering Your Own Style*

So, now that you’ve heard all the arguments for **why** you should flow on paper. But the big question: "**how** do you actually do it" is still there.
> The truth? There’s no single right answer.

## Flowing Is Personal

One of the biggest myths in debate is that there's a *correct* way to flow. That if your flow doesn’t look like your partner’s — or your coach’s, or your camp instructor’s — you're doing it wrong. That’s not true. Flowing is like handwriting or note-taking: it’s about what helps *you* track, respond to, and win debates.

Some people flow super neatly. Some people use symbols and arrows everywhere. Some keep argument tags short; others write full sentences. What matters is that your flow works *for you* — not for the person next to you.

So if your partner’s flow looks like a legal document and yours looks like a comic book? That’s totally fine.


## Vertical or Horizontal Flowing?

This is a classic divide in the debate world:

- **Vertical flowing** means arguments go down the page, with each speech taking up a new column. This is the more traditional, common style, especially in policy or technical LD/CX rounds.
- **Horizontal flowing** means you move across the page as the round progresses, with each speech going left to right in rows. Some lay debaters (especially in PF) use this for simplicity and clarity.

### So which one should you use?

- For **technical or national circuit debate**, vertical flowing is often more efficient for tracking argument development across multiple speeches.
- For **lay or parent-judged debates**, horizontal flowing can help keep the round’s structure more accessible and intuitive.

The format matters less than **your ability to read and respond quickly** — so experiment with both and see what works best.

### How many "Sheets"?

*Now - This one is the only things I will tell you that you **must do***.

There is a reason all of the top debaters flow each argument on a different sheet of paper. Not only is the ability to re-organize arguments a massive advantage, but it stops a packed debate from feeling cramped.


## The Right Paper Makes a Difference

Your notebook matters more than you think.

- **Legal-size paper (8.5" x 14")** gives you more room to work with, especially when doing vertical flows with lots of columns.
- **Standard letter paper (8.5" x 11")** can feel cramped in technical debates but is often enough for PF or shorter-format rounds.

Use whatever feels most comfortable, but if you find yourself running out of space mid-round, it might be time to upgrade.

## Drills to Build Your Flow Skills

Struggling with messy flows? Can’t keep up during fast speeches? Here’s the truth: flowing is a skill, and like any skill, **you can get better with practice.**

Here are some drills to help:

- **Handwriting drills**: If your flows are unreadable, practice writing argument tags clearly and consistently. Repetition helps — even 5–10 minutes a day.
- **Speed drills**: Listen to fast debates or spread recordings and try to flow them in real time. Don’t worry if you miss things at first — just keep going.
- **Shorthand practice**: Develop abbreviations for common words (e.g., “gov” for government, “=>” for causes, “w/o” for without). You can even invent your own — just make sure you remember them.

## What You Should Be Able to Do with Your Flow

The real test of a good flow isn't what it looks like — it's what you can *do* with it.

- Can you look at it after a speech and identify the key arguments and responses?
- Can you explain what happened in the round based only on your flow?
- Can you prep an extension or a block from it, even if your partner flowed slightly differently?

If yes, you're flowing right.

## Final Thoughts

Flowing isn't about being perfect — it's about being *prepared*. The best debaters aren’t the ones with the prettiest flows; they’re the ones who’ve trained their system to work under pressure.

So take time to refine your style. Try vertical or horizontal. Use different paper. Invent your own shorthand. And don’t worry if your flow doesn’t look like anyone else’s — the only person who has to read it is you.
