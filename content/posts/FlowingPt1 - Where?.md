> Why You Should Still Flow on Paper (Even in a Digital Age)

Yes — everyone tells you to flow on paper. But why? I promise it’s not just that they’re grouchy or don’t like change. There’s solid reasoning behind sticking with paper flowing, especially in competitive debate.

The main issue boils down to **screen clutter and cognitive load**. When you’re flowing digitally, you’re juggling multiple windows—your flow document, the master evidence files, the tournament wiki, your browser tabs—and that’s before you even get to typing out arguments in real-time. It’s easy to get overwhelmed or lose track of the flow when everything is bouncing around your screen.

A very insightful video on the DDI Debate channel by Dr. Malsin nails it when she says something I believe is the best line about digital flowing:  
> *“If you don’t carry a second monitor with you, you shouldn’t be flowing online.”*  

Think about it. Without a second screen, you’re forced to switch back and forth constantly, which breaks your concentration and can cause you to miss key points. Paper flowing keeps all your notes visible at once - you can see the entire round’s flow at a glance without toggling windows or scrolling endlessly.


## The Power of Paper Flowing

**Paper flows are simple, reliable, and flexible.** They let you sketch arrows, symbols, shorthand, and make quick margin notes without fumbling through keyboard shortcuts or losing time waiting for apps to load. You’re not tied to power sources or distracted by notifications, either.

Many of the best debaters swear by their paper flows because they’re a tactile, physical record of their rounds. That flowsheet becomes a personal archive, easier to review and reference for future prep.


## What About Judges Flowing Digitally?

Now, I want to make a clear distinction: It’s totally okay for **judges to flow online**. Their needs are different from competitors. Judges don’t have to juggle master evidence files, case files, the tournament wiki, and browser tabs simultaneously. Their job is primarily to track arguments and logic — not manage a complex evidence system.

In my opinion, digital flowing for judges can even be preferable because they can organize notes neatly, search quickly, and type faster than handwriting.

## When You Might Consider Digital Flowing as a Debater

Digital flowing *can* work if you have the right setup. For example, having a second monitor or tablet dedicated just to your flow is a game changer. Some debaters use tablets with styluses for a hybrid experience—digital flexibility with handwriting benefits.

But for most debaters competing at tournaments with limited space, time pressure, and less-than-ideal tech setups, paper flowing remains the gold standard.


## Final Thoughts

Flowing is a fundamental skill in debate, and the medium you choose impacts how well you track and respond to arguments. Paper flowing offers clarity, speed, and simplicity that digital often can’t match without extra gear. So next time someone tells you to flow on paper, remember it’s not about resisting tech — it’s about giving yourself the best chance to keep up and win.
