**I Know I’m Preaching to the Choir here --> But “Breturn” Is a Lazy PF Topic**  
> *Resolved: The United Kingdom should rejoin the European Union.*

Let’s be real: this topic is a rerun. We’ve all seen this movie before, and it wasn’t great the first time.

“Breturn” (possibly "Brenter" // Or maybe even "Brejoin") *tries* to sound nuanced and international. But under the hood? It’s shallow, narrow, and barely topical in 2025. 

It’s the kind of resolution that looks smart to someone who hasn’t ever been in a round. For the rest of us? It’s a dead end.


## The Case Against “Breturn”


### 1. **It’s Incredibly Narrow**  

This isn’t a debate topic. It’s a box.

The moment teams settle on a framework—economic recovery, democratic legitimacy, or voter will—the content becomes painfully predictable. You’ll hear the same handful of stats and impacts every round:

- **Pro:** Trade boosts, GDP rebounds, global clout  
- **Con:** National sovereignty, domestic backlash, regulatory loss

There’s no meaningful room for strategy, no creative link chains, and definitely no space for surprise turns. It’s a treadmill, not a clash.

This topic doesn’t inspire argument—it recycles it.


### 2. **It’s Politically Outdated and Lacks Urgency**  

Let’s be honest: Brexit was big. *Was.*  

But it happened almost a decade ago. And while the fallout was real, it’s not what’s lighting up the headlines in the UK today. According to [YouGov’s 2025 polling](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2025/05/15/what-british-voters-care-about-most), British voters are way more focused on health care, housing, and inflation. “Should we rejoin the EU?” barely cracks the top 10 concerns.  

**In fact, a [2025 Ipsos report](https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/ipsos-issues-index-march-2025) found that fewer than 5% of respondents listed EU membership as one of the top three political issues facing the country—ranking it below climate change, education, and even potholes.**  

Public Forum should tap into livewire issues. This one’s running on fumes.


### 3. **The Topic’s Premise Is Built on Fantasy**  

Saying the UK *should* rejoin the EU assumes that it *can*—easily. But re-entry wouldn’t be a rewind. It would be a renegotiation from scratch, likely with stricter terms than before:

- No opt-outs  
- Mandatory eurozone adoption  
- Full commitment to free movement  

This isn’t just political friction—it’s structural incompatibility. And if your Pro case doesn’t grapple with that, it’s not a real-world position. It’s fan fiction.

Even the [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20240301STO18504/uk-eu-relations-after-brexit-where-do-they-stand-now) has made it clear: rejoining would be a brand-new process, not a return to the past.

**And according to [The Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4cba5d2e-f5d7-4d79-b0b5-6a2055b47e4a), top EU officials remain wary of re-opening negotiations without significant structural reforms and guarantees from the UK—not just on economics, but on rule-of-law and long-term political alignment.**  


### 4. **The Economic Debate Isn’t Just Shallow—It’s Misleading**  

Sure, on paper, the UK rejoining the EU could recoup [$30 billion in annual trade losses](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/22/uk-gdp-down-post-brexit-trade-impact). But that’s based on idealized models—ones that assume frictionless reentry, zero domestic resistance, and static EU policies.  

Reality? Membership costs, political instability, and regulatory tradeoffs eat away at those projections fast. And while Cons like to shout “sovereignty,” few can quantify what that’s actually worth in terms of national outcomes.  

So we end up debating macro buzzwords that fall apart under crossfire.


### 5. **It Reopens Old Wounds Without Offering New Insight**  

This isn’t just an academic exercise. Brexit tore the UK apart. Families, regions, entire generations split down the middle—and many haven’t recovered.

Revisiting that conflict with no realistic policy path forward is more likely to retraumatize than educate. That’s not why we debate.

[Brexit’s lasting social and political divisions](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62206105) are still raw. And there’s no sign that reintroducing the topic brings new solutions—just old scars.


## What *Actually* Makes a Good PF Topic?

A real Public Forum resolution should:

- Be current and resonant  
- Offer multiple strategic paths  
- Encourage clash over *how*, not just *whether*  (NO - I am not suggesting plans - I am suggesting a nuanced debate about empirical delivery)
- Avoid becoming an echo chamber of repeated phrases  

“Breturn” fails on *all fronts*. It masquerades as a complex international issue but delivers a one-note policy trap.


## A Better Option?

If we’re sticking with international trade, let’s make it real:  
**Resolved: The United Kingdom should rejoin the EU customs union.**  

More nuance. More clash. More relevance.

**But, as we all know, it has been voted in already - So we need to just *deal with it***


## TL;DR

“Breturn” is not it. It’s repetitive, reductive, and out of step with 2025. The best PF topics push us to think - And this one doesn't 

We need resolutions that make us *want* to research — Not ones that make us sigh and auto-fill our blocks from week one.
