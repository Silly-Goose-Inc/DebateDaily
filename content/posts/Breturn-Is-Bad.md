I Know I’m Preaching to the Choir, But “Breturn” Is a Bad PF Topic  

**Resolved: The United Kingdom should rejoin the European Union.**  

If you’ve been around Public Forum long enough, you can probably smell a limited topic from a mile away - and this one reeks of repetition. 

The UK rejoining the EU (*nicknamed “Breturn”*): might sound like it has depth, but the actual debates it will generate? Paper-thin. And we haven’t even gotten to the real-world issues yet.

---

## The Case Against “Breturn”

### 1. **It’s way too narrow**

This is the biggest killer. The resolution doesn’t open a real battlefield—it builds a tight hallway.

Once teams pick a framework—economic stability, political legitimacy, or public opinion—it’s pretty much copy and paste from there. Every Pro will cite the same projected GDP bumps from rejoining, and every Con will rattle off sovereignty talking points and voter backlash. By week two, you’ll be hearing the same three impacts in every round:

- **Pro:** Trade improvement, economic recovery, global alliances  
- **Con:** Sovereignty, cost, political polarization

No unique links. No creative strategy. Just well-rehearsed scripts being repeated over and over again.

This isn’t a resolution—it’s a funnel.

### 2. **It’s politically stale and lacks salience**  

Yeah, Brexit was seismic… in 2016. But by now, even British voters are tired of the conversation. Polls show a slim majority might support rejoining, but ask anyone under 25 about their current concerns and they’ll list the NHS, housing, and inflation first. Brexit isn’t front of mind anymore ([YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk), 2025 polling data).  

Debate thrives on urgency. This resolution lacks it.

---

### 3. **It rests on idealized assumptions**

A “yes” vote doesn’t magically rewind the clock. Rejoining the EU isn’t plug-and-play. Britain would almost certainly be forced to adopt the euro, accept full freedom of movement, and lose many of the opt-outs it held before. These aren't footnotes—they’re core roadblocks.

So unless every Pro team plans to pretend the EU will welcome Britain back with a warm croissant and no demands, we’re entering fantasy territory.

---

### 4. **The economic side is all over the place**

There’s data—sure. But most of it assumes perfect terms. On paper, rejoining would restore $30 billion in lost trade annually. But that’s before you factor in membership costs, domestic opposition, and the loss of control over key regulatory levers.  

Even Con teams struggle here. It’s easy to say “sovereignty good,” but hard to quantify exactly how remaining outside the EU makes Britain more stable in the long term.  

What we’re left with is a shallow pool of macroeconomic buzzwords that don’t hold up to scrutiny.

---

### 5. **It risks reigniting political trauma**  

Public Forum doesn’t need to re-traumatize nations. The Brexit referendum was one of the most divisive events in modern British history. Reopening that wound with no clear implementation plan or electoral consensus is a recipe for more social unrest, not less.

---

## What Makes a Good PF Topic?

Let’s stack this up. A solid Public Forum resolution should:

- Be timely and engaging
- Offer a wide range of clash
- Allow Diverse Frameworks and unique interpretations
- Avoid super niche background ("Need2Know")_

*Breturn* fails all of these. It’s a niche foreign policy thought experiment disguised as a sweeping policy question.

## A Better Alternative?

Want to keep the international trade flavor but give debaters room to move?

NSDA - Try:  
**“Resolved: The UK should rejoin the EU customs union.”**  

---

## TL;DR

I know I’m preaching to the choir—but this topic is narrow, repetitive, and misleading. It’s built for surface-level talking points and scripted impact dumps, not true nuanced debates.

Let’s push for topics that actually reward research, creativity, and education—not ones that sound international but play out like glorified policy Mad Libs.
