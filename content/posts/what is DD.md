*Debate Daily* is a project I’ve been working on with a long-term goal in mind: building a structured, useful space for competitive debaters, coaches, and teams — one that combines tools, commentary, and systems under one roof.

It’s a multi-part site, developed slowly and deliberately, with an emphasis on clarity, community use, and long-term utility. It’s being coded by hand — line by line — not generated or stitched together by AI. The goal is to make something you’d actually want to use across a full season, not just browse once and forget.

## What *Debate Daily* Will Actually Include


### 1. **Logos Tools**

This section of the site is focused on the technical side of prep. It will include updated versions of utilities like the Verbatim Parser and other small formatting or file-handling tools. These are being rebuilt from scratch — lightweight, clean, and updated for current workflows.

Eventually, this part of the project will also include speech document helpers, fast round labeling tools, and maybe even integrations to make tournament prep a bit smoother.

### 2. **Debate, Decoded**

This will serve as both a prep file system and a running skill-building guide — almost like a hybrid between drill index, concept archive, and light curriculum.

Here you’ll find:
- Strategy write-ups and concept breakdowns  
- Drill templates and walkthroughs  
- Framework modules and clash tutorials  
- Lightweight prep files tied to topic-specific or skill-specific goals  

It's not designed to replace instruction — just to supplement it in a way that’s more readable and adaptable than a stack of Google Docs.

### 3. **The Brief** (Blog)

This part will function as a long-form commentary section — inspired by older blogs like *3NR*. Posts will cover:
- Tournament analysis and postmortems  
- Strategy commentary  
- Circuit-specific developments  
- Coaching-focused content  

After every major bid tournament, there will be a breakdown post covering major arguments, performance notes, and structural trends. For local and regional circuits, there will also be coverage — including speaker rankings, team records, and judge notes when appropriate.

All updates here will be written and reviewed by hand — no AI-generated recaps or filler.

## The Philosophy

This site is being built slowly - and intentionally — around a few core values:

- **Clarity over complexity**  
- **Structure over clutter**  
- **Actual use over flashy features**

The goal is to build a system that’s useful to debaters and coaches on a daily basis — whether that’s to prep for the TOC or track attendance at a local circuit tournament.
