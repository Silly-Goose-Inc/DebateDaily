Let’s be real - people don’t flow anymore.

They may jot a few things down, (maybe) scribble some tags or click through tabs. But actually tracking arguments across an entire debate round? Keeping up with the line-by-line? Remembering what was conceded and how to leverage that?

It’s not happening. And that’s a problem.

## 1st: What Even *Is* Flowing?

At its core, flowing is just keeping track. Line by line, speech by speech, argument by argument. It’s what allows you to clash, collapse, extend, and win — because you actually know what’s going on.

Used to be, flowing was a skill everyone learned *first*. You’d get handed a pad and a pen and told to practice over and over until your flow was clean, fast, and readable. Now, we’re seeing more and more debaters who don’t flow at all — or don’t really know how.


## 2nd: Why It Matters

When people stop flowing, debate gets worse - Here’s why:

### A - **You Miss Key Arguments:**  
If you don’t flow, you forget stuff. You drop important parts of the case. You can’t track turns or identify what your opponent conceded. You end up repeating your case over and over instead of adapting.

### B - **Off-Case Goes Nowhere:**  
Good DA debate depends on flowing. If you don’t know where your link answer landed or which part of the impact they dropped, you’re stuck throwing generic responses at the wall. Same goes for T and theory — it’s all about structure.

### C - **Cross-Ex Falls Apart:**  
Cross should be where you poke holes in your opponent’s logic, force them into contradictions, or set up later speeches. But you can’t do that if you don’t remember what they said. Without a flow, your questions get vague — and your opponent gets away with weak arguments.

### D - **Line-by-Line Stops Existing:**  
A proper line-by-line round — where each argument is answered, tagged, extended, and weighed — needs a solid flow. Without it, debates turn into speech contests: who sounds better, who has better cards, who’s louder. That’s not what debate’s about.

## 3rd: So... Why Did People Stop Flowing?

A few things happened.

- **A - Speed went up.** A lot of younger debaters struggle to keep up, so they give up on flowing altogether.  
- **B - Tech took over.** People got comfortable just opening blocks, writing new ones mid-round, or copying from teammates — not actually listening.  
- **C - We stopped teaching it.** Flowing isn’t glamorous. It’s not a flashy speech skill. But it’s necessary. And if no one teaches it, no one does it.

## 4th: Flowing Isn’t "Old School" — It’s Essential

You don’t have to use paper. Plenty of people flow well on laptops or tablets. But it’s not about the tool — it’s about the *habit*.

Flowing forces you to listen. It forces you to engage. And it teaches you how to *think* like a strategist, not just a speaker.

The best debaters don’t win because they speak fast. They win because they track arguments better, collapse cleaner, and make judges’ decisions easier. That starts with flowing.

## 5th: If You’re Not Flowing, Start Now

Here’s how to build the habit:

- **Find a system that works for you.** Maybe it’s color coding. Maybe it’s shorthand. Maybe it’s old-fashioned legal pads. Just make it consistent.  
- **Practice under pressure.** Don’t just flow your own rounds. Flow videos. Flow other teams. The more you do it, the faster and cleaner it gets.  
- **Make your flow your guide.** Don’t let your speeches float off instinct. Base your strategy on what’s actually happening in the round.

## Final Thoughts

Flowing isn’t optional. It’s the difference between guessing and knowing, between talking and winning.

So if you care about debate — if you care about becoming a better debater — bring back the flow.

Track arguments. Stay sharp. And take pride in it.
