# Debate Daily
> Built by debaters — for debaters. And coded by two sleep-deprived students (Uni And HS).

Debate Daily is a living hub for speech and debate competitors. We’re combining writing, tech, and data to build the tools we *wish* existed when we started: smarter stat tracking, honest article commentary, tech tips, and digital resources — all built for modern forensics.

## 🤖 What’s Inside

This repo houses both the code and content behind Debate Daily, including:

### The Articles
A growing archive of Markdown posts on:
- Tournament tips and strategy breakdowns
- Commentary and culture (both honest and a little spicy)
- Judge feedback, prep hacks, and tool reviews

### The Debate Tracker (WIP)
A full-featured Flask app built to help coaches and captains:
- Track student performance by round, judge, and tournament
- View speaker point averages, bid progress, and RFD patterns
- Edit student records like a spreadsheet
- Eventually auto-sync with Tabroom.com (stay tuned)

✌️ Team Behind the Magic

Built by:
- Fisher — dev, designer, and voice behind most articles (and the 2x2 in CX)
- Christina — Musical genius, Ethos Master, and co-architect of the Debate Tracker GUI.

Together, we’re shipping tools we actually use at tournaments — in between rounds, crashes, and existential speeches.

Debate is more than competition — it’s a skillset, a culture, and a game we all keep learning. Debate Daily is our way of giving back. Let’s build something better — one round at a time.
